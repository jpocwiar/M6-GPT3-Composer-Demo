# M<sup>6</sup>-(GPT)<sup>3</sup>: Generating Multitrack Modifiable Multi-Minute MIDI Music from Text using Genetic algorithms, Probabilistic methods and GPT Models in any Progression and Time signature 

This work introduces the M<sup>6</sup>-(GPT)<sup>3</sup> Composer system, capable of generating complete, multi-minute musical compositions with complex structures in any time signature, in the MIDI domain from input descriptions in natural language. The system utilizes an autoregressive transformer language model to map natural language prompts to composition parameters in JSON format. The defined structure includes time signature, scales, chord progressions, and valence-arousal values, from which accompaniment, melody, bass, motif, and percussion tracks are created. We propose a genetic algorithm for the generation of melodic elements. The algorithm incorporates mutations with musical significance and a fitness function based on normal distribution and predefined musical feature values. The values adaptively evolve, influenced by emotional parameters and distinct playing styles. The system for generating percussion in any time signature utilises probabilistic methods, including Markov chains. Through both human and objective evaluations, we demonstrate that our music generation approach outperforms baselines on specific, musically meaningful metrics, offering a valuable alternative to purely neural network-based systems.

## Example generations
To present the functionality of the system, I generated couple of songs using descriptions from [Meta's MusicGen](https://audiocraft.metademolab.com/musicgen.html) and [Google's MusicLM](https://google-research.github.io/seanet/musiclm/examples/) sites. Presented wav files are automatically synthesized from MIDI using General MIDI soundfont, so they have quite basic instrument sounding. They can however be used to synthesize with finer samples.

Mind, that system generates full songs with various sections, for example verse, chorus, bridge, so things like overall mood / scales change as the song progresses.

### Modifying compositions
The system is also capable of modifying previously generated compositions to the user's needs. Table below presents prompts that modify the composition, compositions themselves, as well as time signature, tempo and structure.

Prompt: Add a Bach-inspired passage before the solo begins. Let's also use
a different instrumentation for the solo to better fit in with the rest. You can also change the guitar, because it doesn't
fit very well. Let's change the time signature to 13/8. Remember that the duration of chords is given in
bars.
